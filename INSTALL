    SGT is available at CPAN:

              http://search.cpan.org/dist/SGT/

===================================================================

Dependencies:

none

===================================================================

Installation:

If you have administrative privileges you can install the SGT
package by running the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will install the module in system directories (/usr/bin/ etc). In
this case, it's very likely that you will be able to run SGT, without having 
to explicitly set any environment variables.

If you do not have administrative privileges, you can use the PREFIX variable 
to specify a directory to which you have write access, and you can use the  
LIB variable to specify the directory where the module is supposed to be installed:

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/mydirectory/SGT LIB=/home/mydirectory/SGT/lib
make
make test
make install

The SGT Perl module will be installed in $LIB/lib. 

To use the SGT package, you will need to set your PATH variable to
include $PREFIX/bin and the PERL5LIB variable to include the $LIB/lib  
directory locations. These are displayed during the execution of 'make  
install', so please make a note of them and be sure to set your  
environment variables accordingly.
