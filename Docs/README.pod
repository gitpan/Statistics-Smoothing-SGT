    README for SGT package

    Last updated for version 2.10, 12 January 2007

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    This document provides a general introduction to the SGT
    package.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This Perl module implements the Simple Good Turing (SGT) algorithm 
    for smoothing of probabilistic values developed by William Gale and 
    Geoffrey Sampson. 

    The algorithm is described in detail in Sampson's Empirical Linguistics
    (Continuum International, London and New York, 2001), chapter 7.
    An online version of this paper is available at Geoffrey Sampson's
    homepage under http://www.grsampson.net/AGtf.html .
    
    Basic usage:

	use Statistics::Smoothing::SGT;
	my $sgt = new Statistics::Smoothing::SGT($frequencyClasses, $total);
	$sgt->calculateSGTValues();
  	$probabilities = $sgt->getProbabilities();
  	$newFrequencies = $sgt->getNewFrequencies();
  	$nBar = $sgt->getNBar();
