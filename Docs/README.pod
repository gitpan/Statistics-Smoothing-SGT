=head1 SYNOPSIS

    This document provides a general introduction to the SGT
    package.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This Perl module implements the Simple Good Touring (SGT) algorithm 
    for smoothing of probabilistic values developed by William Gale and 
    Geoffrey Sampson. 

    The algorithm is described in the following article: 
    http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~danr/Teaching/CS598-05/Papers/Gale-Sampson-smoothgoodturing.pdf
    
    Basic usage:

	use Statistics::Smoothing::SGT;
	my $sgt = new SGT($frequencyClasses, $total);
	$sgt->calculateSGTValues();
  	$probabilities = $sgt->getProbabilities();
  	$newFrequencies = $sgt->getNewFrequencies();
  	$nBar = $sgt->getNBar();
